# Neural-Network-for-Data-Classification
## Objective
The project is using an insurance data set. The purpose is to use the numeric attributes to classify the customers into policy buyers and non buyers. 


## Method
- Take 66% for training. Used Stratified sampling, 2 strata.
- Neural Network: Forward Propagation and Error Backpropagation. Used one hidden layers, Sigmoid activation. 
- L^2 regularized cost function.
